## Challenge

Simple React app that allows the user to search for a location, and in turn get the relevant weather information.


## Features

 - Implemented a theme switcher i.e. **Dark / Light Mode**
 - Maked style responsive
 - Implemented new components and API responses like  : Humidity , Temperature, WindSpeed, Location's name, city and country.
 
## API Responses

Due to the hight amount of calls to the API server my account is temporarily disabled, therefore you need to wait for the API server to be available before continuing.
